Wi-Fi Evil Twin Attack Tool
This project is a demonstration of a Wi-Fi Evil Twin attack. The tool creates a fake wireless access point (AP) that mimics a legitimate one to trick users into connecting. Once connected, data can be captured to analyze potential vulnerabilities.

Use it only on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized usage may violate laws and regulations.

Features
Clone legitimate Wi-Fi SSID and AP configurations.
Deauthentication of users from the original AP.
Logging of connected devices and captured packets.
Requirements
Linux-based system (e.g., Kali Linux, Parrot OS).
Wireless network adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.
Python 3.x installed with necessary dependencies.
Tools such as aircrack-ng, hostapd, and dnsmasq.
